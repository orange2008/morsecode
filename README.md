# Head
This is a feature detached from <a href="https://github.com/shuairuan/orsh">ORSH</a>. So it has etc, proc folder. Because I just bored to change the source code XDDDD.

IT DOESN'T SUPPORT SYMBOLS!(Part of the reason is I can't find a list of Morse code of symbols XDD)

Everything was built in Python 3.
No OS requirements.
# Directory Structure
etc/ --- System folder(Forked from ORSH)

proc/ --- Temporary folder

main.py --- Main Program
# Run
python3 main.py or main.py
